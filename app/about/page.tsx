          <p className="about-origin-question">If a project is creating a measurable environmental benefit, why is participation in the carbon market still so difficult?</p>
          <p>Because the activity is only the beginning. A workable pathway also needs eligibility assessment, an appropriate methodology, usable records, monitoring, applicable independent processes and a buyer conversation. Vayucred exists to help project owners work through that gap without losing sight of the real project underneath.</p>
